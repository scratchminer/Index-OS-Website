        <p class="text">Here's a list of things you'll need before we begin:<br>• A computer! Any's fine, as long as you can use it to access the Playdate's disk.<br>• An unlocked Playdate console (that is, one that lets you access the System partition.)<br>• The Index OS .pdx file (<a href="download">Get it if you haven't already!</a>)</p>

        <h1 class="head">Dropping it in</h1>
        <p class="text">First, boot your console into System disk mode. If your Playdate's unlocked, you should know how to do this. Next, head into the System folder, located on the root of BERNARD. There, you'll find the .pdx for the stock Launcher - we <i>strongly</i> recommend keeping that file around in case you ever wanna switch back! Just rename it something else.<br><br>Next, drag the Index OS.pdx file into that folder, and rename it to 'Launcher.pdx'. Now eject your console, restart it if necessary, and you should be up and running on Index!</p>
